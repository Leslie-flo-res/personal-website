        Hi there my name is Leslie. I was born and raised in Calgary. I
        currently work as a surgical processor with Alberta Health Services and
        have been working there for the past 7 years, while my time there has
        been a gratifying experience, I found myself fascinated by front end
        tutorials. Leading my decision to go part time and work towards becoming
        a part of the web development world. During my free time I like to
        practice pyrography art , painting and some light gaming.
