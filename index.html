      Hi there my name is Leslie. I was born and raised in Calgary. I currently
      work as a surgical processor with Alberta Health Services and have been
      working there for the past 7 years, while my time there has been a
      gratifying experience, I found myself fascinated by front end tutorials.
      Leading my decision to go part time and work towards becoming a part of
      the web development world. During my free time I like to practice
      pyrography art , painting and some light gaming.
